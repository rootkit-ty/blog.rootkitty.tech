# An update and Github pages

## The update

Well it's been a while since I've posted anything, and that's because life has gotten a little hectic and haven't had as much time dedicated to this blog.

I have a few draft posts that I'll continue to work on until they get published and I have a few more planned. Hopefully they'll be interesting and provide an insight.

## Github Pages

I will be making the move to github pages with this blog, and away from S3, purely because it costs me money.

I will also be setting up the blog to have a CD (continuous deployment) pipeline, on which I will expand further on another blog post.

As for now this is really all I have to provide in terms of information regarding this blog, but I'll make sure to keep you all up to date.

If you want more constant updates on things my, [twitter](https://twitter.com/rootkit_ty) is the way to go.
