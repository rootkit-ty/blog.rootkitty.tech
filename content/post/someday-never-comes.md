I must admit something. I'm a master at procrastination. More then your
average person. You may be reading this thinking "Ha, I bet I'm worse" and
perhaps you are, but to give context as to how bad I am let me tell you a
story.

I once kept paying rent on a place I hadn't visited in 3 months. That was
literally thousands of dollars wasted, because I procrastinated canceling the
lease.

That was not a freak occurrence either. I'm well known for procrastinating
pretty much everything. I think between my ADHD, Anxiety and bad memory, they
have created this perfect storm of not getting shit done.

I get anxious about calling someone, so I put it off, get distracted, and
forget.

I even procrastinated making this blog post ironically, to help put things
into perspective. I still haven't mastered the art of getting stuff done, but
I sure am getting close.

I also have the issue of pushing things back till after a hectic part of my
life. Like putting off booking a holiday till after my friend comes down.

There is an issue with this approach.

Because I have another admission to make, I'm always under the assumption I
am going to die, probably early in life. My entire life has been governed
by this fear, I fill up my free time with stuff. I never want to waste a
moment. Not spend a day watching TV for entertainment, nor play games for days
on end.

This means my life is always hectic and filled with things I can use to put
other things off with. By saying "oh after this hectic period". If I keep
putting things off till someday, they'll never get done. Because someday never
comes.

Hopefully this has given you some motivation to start and do something, and
not wait for someday. If I can do it, you probably can too.

Remember motivation is key. Create a system for tracking tasks, and stick to
it. If it says "Go to the Gym", go. Don't skip one day, cause that makes it
easy to rationalize the next time you skip. Keep the chain, once a habit is
built up, it's a lot easier.
