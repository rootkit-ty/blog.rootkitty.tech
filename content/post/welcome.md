Hello and welcome to my blog. This domain has beeen parked for some time while I attempted to find a nice blogging software, but I think found it.

## Content

Anyway, welcome to the blog I hope you enjoy it's content. What content? Well none at this current time but it'll essentially be a journal of all my escapades. Malware analysis, projects, and even just notes.

## About me
Enough about the blog, and more about me. Who am I? Well I'm an idiot with an interest in technology. I am quite interested in security, and have some basic programming knowledge.
