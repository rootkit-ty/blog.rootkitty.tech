So I recently just enabled comments on this blog, it'd be great to see what you
all think of my posts, and I'd love to hear from you. Now I chose this provider
for their the privacy policy which seams fairly good. Although they do use
Google Firebase, which **MAY** be used to track users, but I am not sure. I hope
not.

I will implementing a click to both see and post comments, so it'll only be
loaded by your interaction, and you'll be given a warning.
